# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following. Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
90%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I watch lectures on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 6-8pm at home, and complete practicals on Thursday afternoons 
from 2-5pm in the library or computer lab.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I'm staying on top of lecture videos and completing practicals on time. I'm also making an effort to write clean, 
readable code and I'm not afraid to ask for help when I'm stuck, which has helped me understand concepts better.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop procrastinating on starting tasks. I often wait until closer to the deadline when I should start earlier.
I also need to practice more outside of the scheduled practical times to reinforce concepts, and I'm still struggling 
with the Git/GitHub workflow, so I need to dedicate time to understanding it better.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I need to improve my Git commit discipline. 
I often forget to commit regularly and don't always write meaningful commit messages. I also rush through instructions 
and miss important details, which leads to mistakes. I need to slow down, read carefully, and test my code more 
thoroughly before moving on.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I'm completing the practicals on time and producing working code. I'm also good at asking questions when I need help 
rather than staying stuck for too long.
